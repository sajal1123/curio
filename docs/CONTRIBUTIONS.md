## Technology Overview

| Component | Technology                             | Function                                                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend   | Python, Flask                          | REST API for managing users, workflows, and provenance               |
| Frontend  | JavaScript, UTK, Vega-Lite             | Browser-based interface for authoring and interacting with dataflows |
| Execution | Python sandbox (multiprocess)          | Secure module for executing user code                                |
| DevOps    | Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions | Containerization, deployment, and CI/CD                              |
| Packaging | PyPI (`utk-curio`)                     | Distributes the CLI and backend/frontend bundle                      |

## Repository Structure

The codebase follows a modular structure under the `utk_curio/` directory. This separation supports clean boundaries between backend, frontend, and execution logic.

```
curio/
├── utk_curio/
│   ├── backend/                     # Manages database access and user authentication
│   │   └── tests/                   # pytest files for backend
│   ├── sandbox/                     # Executes user Python code in a secure environment
│   │   └── tests/                   # pytest files for sandbox
│   └── frontend/                    # All frontend logic
│       ├── urban-workflows/         # Main Curio interface for dataflow editing
│       │   └── src/

├── tests/                          # Dataflow examples for testing
├── docs/                           # Markdown documentation and usage guides

└── requirements.txt                # Backend and sandbox dependencies
```

## Installation Options

### Via pip (lightweight setup)

```bash
pip install utk-curio
curio start
```

This installs the CLI and a pre-built version of the frontend. You won’t be able to modify or rebuild the UI from this setup.

### From GitHub (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/urban-toolkit/curio.git
cd curio
python curio.py start
```

Refer to [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for Docker instructions and frontend build steps.

## Suggested Contribution Paths

### Testing and Debugging

* Write or improve `pytest` tests in `backend/tests` and `sandbox/tests`
* Reproduce and resolve issues from GitHub
* Extend test coverage for edge cases

### Developing Dataflow Nodes

* Add new analytic operations as reusable nodes
* Improve UI and metadata descriptions

### Example Workflows

* Create dataflow examples using public datasets
* Annotate dataflows to serve as tutorials
* Contribute to the `examples/` directory

### Documentation

* Write developer setup instructions or onboarding checklists
* Add usage diagrams, screenshots, or schema explanations
* Contribute inline documentation and docstrings

### Community and Support

* Test Curio across platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* Suggest improvements to onboarding and usability

## Getting Started (Step-by-Step)

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

To fork the repository, visit the [Curio GitHub page](https://github.com/urban-toolkit/curio) and click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner (for more details see GitHub's [Forking a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)). This will create a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

After forking:

1. Clone your fork to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/curio.git
   cd curio
   ```
2. Set the original repository as an upstream remote so you can keep your fork up to date:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/urban-toolkit/curio.git
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   conda create -n curio python=3.10
   conda activate curio
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the system**

   ```bash
   python curio.py start
   ```

5. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

6. **Make your changes and commit when you are done**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: feature description"
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

7. **Submit a pull request**
   Open a PR on GitHub with a detailed description and link to relevant issues.

## Organizing Contributions

To maintain the codebase, contributors are encouraged to submit detailed issues or focused pull requests. The following guidelines and templates can help you structure contributions clearly and effectively.

### Defining the Scope of a Pull Request

When creating a PR, it's important to have a clear, focused scope. Each PR should ideally address a single feature or issue. Avoid mixing unrelated changes as it makes the review process harder and less transparent. If you need to address multiple unrelated changes, create separate branches and PRs for each.

**Focus on:**

* One feature addition
* One bug fix
* One set of related documentation updates

If your PR grows beyond a single scope, consider splitting it into multiple PRs.

### Pull Request Template

To help maintain consistency and clarity, use the following template when creating a Pull Request:

```md
### Description
<!-- A brief description of what your PR does. Include the purpose and context. -->

### Related Issue
<!-- If this PR addresses an issue, provide the issue number or link. -->

### Changes
<!-- List the changes or additions you've made. For example:
- Added a new API endpoint to retrieve user profiles.
- Fixed a typo in the README.
-->

### Impact
<!-- Describe who will be affected by these changes and how. For instance:
- Users now have the ability to do X.
- Bug Y is no longer encountered.
-->

### Testing
<!-- Detail any steps or tests taken to ensure the code works as intended.
Include steps for reviewers to reproduce and verify your changes:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm test`
3. Confirm that all tests pass and the new feature works as expected.
-->

### Additional Notes
<!-- Any additional context, concerns, or follow-ups. For example, mention if docs need to be updated after merging. -->
```

### Issue Template

Issues are the best way to report bugs, request new features, or start a discussion around potential changes. Before creating a new issue, make sure to:

* Check if the issue already exists.
* Provide as much relevant detail as possible.

Use the following template when creating a new issue:

```md
### Summary
<!-- Provide a concise description of the issue. -->

### Steps to Reproduce
<!-- List the steps to replicate the problem -->

### Expected Result
<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->

### Actual Result
<!-- What actually happened? -->

### Environment
<!-- OS, Browser, Node version, Branch, etc. -->

### Additional Information
<!-- Screenshots, logs, temporary workarounds, etc. -->
```

## Advice for Students

* Start small - improving documentation or examples is a valuable first step.
* Ask questions early, especially if you're unfamiliar with the stack.
* Use GitHub Issues to propose ideas and get feedback.
* Consider pairing contributions with coursework or independent study.
* If you're committing to a larger contribution, reach out for mentorship.

## Need Help

* Join the [Curio Discord server](https://discord.gg/vjpSMSJR8r)
* Post in the GitHub Discussions or Issues tab

## Final Notes

Every contribution helps. You don’t need deep expertise—just curiosity, commitment, and a willingness to learn.
