# Example: Adding interaction between Vega-Lite and UTK

This examples covers a simple interaction between a Vega-Lite plot and a UTK visualization. This examples uses the [Project Sidewalk](https://projectsidewalk.org) sample data available [here](data/interaction.zip).

## Step 1: Loading data

Once you have downloaded the [datasets](data/interaction.zip), upload  them into Curio using the **Upload Dataset** functionality.

## Step 2: Connecting UTK to Vega-Lite plots

To link UTK interactions with Vega-Lite plots, create data and interaction edges from a data pool node like the image below:

<img src="./images/interaction-1.png" title="" alt="Interaction 1" data-align="center">

Select "Picking" as the interaction for UTK. The nodes will be populated with pre-defined code. Linked interactions can only work if they are connected to a data pool as shown in the image.

You can download a JSON specification with this example [here](./data/interaction.json).
